      <h1>Our Founding Story</h1>
        <p>
            In the early days of 2010, two visionary minds, Dr. Allison Harper and Tech Innovator Ethan Mitchell, came together with
            a shared dream â€” to revolutionize healthcare and make a lasting impact on the well-being of individuals worldwide.

            Dr. Harper, a seasoned healthcare professional with a passion for patient-centered care, had witnessed the gaps in 
            accessibility and personalized attention in the healthcare industry. Meanwhile, Ethan Mitchell, a brilliant tech 
            entrepreneur, envisioned a future where advanced technology could seamlessly integrate with healthcare, enhancing
            the overall experience for patients.
